## 🎯 CI/CD Strategy

- ✅ **Manual approval required** (human oversight)

### Branch Strategy
- **`dev`**: Development testing (push freely)
- **`staging`**: Pre-production QA (merge from dev)
- **`main`**: Production release (manual deploy only)

### Deployment Process
1. Develop on `dev` branch
2. Merge to `staging` for QA testing
3. Manual review & approval from team lead
4. Merge `staging` → `main`
5. **Manual deploy**: `firebase deploy` or Netlify/Vercel manual trigger
6. Lock deploy settings after deployment

### Rollback Plan
```bash
# Git rollback
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main

# Firebase rollback
firebase hosting:rollback
```
