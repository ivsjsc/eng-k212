## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations:

1. **AI Features**: Still using demo data
   - Need real API integration
   - Backend for usage tracking needed

2. **Ebook Assets**: Need to upload image files
   - `/public/assets/sw8/` - Grade 8
   - `/public/assets/sw9/` - Grade 9
   - `/public/assets/g10/` - Grade 10
   - `/public/assets/g11/` - Grade 11
   - `/public/assets/g12/` - Grade 12

3. **Guest Progress**: Not persisted on server
   - Using localStorage only
   - Need backend API for persistence

### Future Enhancements:

- Real AI API integration (OpenAI/Gemini)
- Backend user tracking system
- More demo content
- Mobile app version
